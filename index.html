      <div class="card intro-card">
        <div class="intro-text">
          <h3>What is EcoSort about?</h3>
          <p>
            EcoSort focuses on the simple moment when a person stands in front of a bin and tries to decide where an item should go.
            This everyday choice determines whether materials stay in circulation or end up as permanent waste.
            Many people rely on quick visual judgment, which often leads to items being placed in the wrong bin.
            These small errors matter because a single misplaced object can contaminate an entire batch of materials.
            <strong>EcoSort is concerned with these real-world decisions.</strong>
            By looking closely at images of common objects, the project highlights how people interpret waste based on visual cues alone.
            This perspective helps reveal how ordinary choices accumulate into larger patterns that affect communities and the environment.

          <h3>Background: how waste systems work</h3>
          <p>
            Waste systems begin at a bin but extend through long chains of trucks, workers, and sorting facilities that handle thousands of items each day.
            Once something is thrown away, it enters a process designed to separate what can be reused from what must be discarded.
            These systems rely heavily on items being sorted correctly at the start because early mistakes are difficult to correct later.
            <strong>When contaminated or incorrect items enter recycling streams, entire loads can lose value and be rejected.</strong>
            Rejected loads often end up in landfills even when many items inside were recyclable.
            This outcome increases waste, energy use, and environmental impact.
            Understanding this background shows why small decisions at the bin can have large consequences downstream.

          <h3>Who is affected by mis-sorted waste?</h3>
          <p>
            Mis-sorted waste affects a wide range of people, even though most never see the consequences directly.
            Residents may believe they recycled correctly, only to learn that contamination caused an entire load to be discarded.
            Workers at sorting facilities face additional effort and safety risks when they must remove items that do not belong.
            Cities and campuses often pay higher fees when loads are rejected or require special handling.
            <strong>These costs ultimately fall on communities that rely on predictable and affordable waste services.</strong>
            Over time, mis-sorting reduces the effectiveness of recycling programs and public trust in the system.
            The combined impact touches households, workers, local budgets, and the environment.

        <div class="intro-text">
          <h3>Why does better sorting matter?</h3>
          <p>
            Proper sorting helps keep valuable materials in circulation rather than sending them to landfills.
            When recyclables remain clean and separated, they can be turned into new products with less energy and fewer raw materials.
            This reduces pressure on natural resources such as metals, timber, and fossil fuels.
            <strong>Better sorting also lowers emissions, saves energy, and improves the overall efficiency of recycling systems.</strong>
            Communities and campuses that sort correctly are more likely to meet sustainability goals and reduce waste costs.
            Clean, well-organized waste streams also lead to clearer public spaces and more reliable waste services.
            These benefits show why small choices at the bin carry long-term importance.

      <div class="card intro-card">
        <div class="intro-text">
          <h3>Where do images fit into this story?</h3>
          <p>
            Images play an important role in understanding how people sort waste because visual appearance shapes most sorting decisions.
            The shape, texture, and condition of an item influence whether a person believes it belongs in recycling, compost, or landfill.
            These details matter because people often rely on quick visual cues rather than reading labels or instructions.
            <strong>By examining many photos of common waste items, EcoSort reveals patterns in how people interpret these objects.</strong>
            Images make it easier to compare what items look like and how easily they might be mistaken for something else.
            This visual perspective provides a simple entry point into understanding everyday sustainability challenges.
            EcoSort uses these images to explore how clearer cues could eventually support better sorting habits.

            <div class="card">
              <p>
                EcoSort uses a public image collection known as the TrashNet dataset. The dataset contains
                photographs of common waste items placed on a simple background, grouped into six categories:
                cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and mixed trash. Each image represents a single item,
                such as a cardboard box, a plastic bottle, or a crushed can. These labeled examples form the
                starting point for teaching a model how different types of materials tend to look.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before any modeling can happen, the images need to be organized and cleaned. In this project,
                all photographs are resized to a consistent shape so that they can be processed in the same way.
                The dataset is then divided into three parts: a training set that the model learns from, a
                validation set used to tune the model, and a test set reserved for final evaluation. Simple
                visual checks help confirm that the categories are balanced and that the images are clear,
                recognizable, and aligned with their labels. Links to the raw and processed data are provided
                so that others can reproduce these steps.

            <div class="card">
              <p>
                At the heart of EcoSort is a type of model that is commonly used for images: a Convolutional
                Neural Network (CNN). Rather than working with raw text or numbers alone, a CNN is designed
                to look at pixel patterns and gradually build up an understanding of shapes, edges, and textures.
                With enough examples, the model can begin to recognize that crumpled paper tends to look
                different from transparent plastic, and that glass bottles reflect light in a distinctive way.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this project, the CNN is trained to take a single waste image as input and assign it to
                one of the six categories. The training process adjusts the internal parameters of the model
                so that its predictions align more closely with the labeled examples over time. Alongside the
                core model, additional tools such as Grad-CAM visualizations are used to highlight which parts
                of the image the network is focusing on when it makes a decision. This helps connect the
                technical behavior of the model back to something humans can interpret and reason about.

            <h2>How well does EcoSort perform?</h2>
            <div class="card">
              <p>
                After training, EcoSort is evaluated on a set of images it has never seen before. For each
                photograph, the model is asked to predict the correct category, and its answers are compared
                against the true labels. The overall accuracy gives a single summary of how often EcoSort is
                correct, but a more detailed view comes from a confusion matrix, which shows which categories
                are most frequently mistaken for one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, the model performs strongly on clearly separated materials such as glass and
                cardboard, while showing more uncertainty when items are partially damaged, crumpled, or
                visually similar across categories. These patterns mirror the real-world challenges of
                recycling, where a slightly contaminated item can easily be misidentified. Example predictions
                and heatmaps from Grad-CAM provide concrete illustrations of when EcoSort is confident, when
                it hesitates, and where it directs its attention within each image.

          <h2>From images to more mindful waste systems</h2>
          <p>
            EcoSort does not claim to solve recycling, but it shows that even a relatively simple image-based
            model can reliably recognize common materials and highlight where confusion tends to arise. The
            project suggests that automated classification could act as a quiet assistant in the background:
            guiding smart bins, supporting staff at sorting facilities, or providing feedback in educational
            settings where people are still learning what goes where. By surfacing which items are consistently
            mis-sorted, such systems can also inform better signage, clearer instructions, and more thoughtful
            design of collection points.

            More broadly, this work is an example of how neural networks can be pointed at everyday sustainability
            problems rather than only abstract benchmarks. Turning a single photo into a category label is a small
            step, but it opens a path toward waste streams that are cleaner, less contaminated, and easier to
            process. EcoSort invites future extensions: adding compostable materials, handling mixed scenes with
            multiple items, or moving from controlled backgrounds to real-world environments like campuses,
            offices, and city streets. Each of these steps could make automated support for sorting feel less like
            a futuristic idea and more like a practical tool for reducing waste.

          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>
            EcoSort was developed as a neural networks course project exploring how computer vision can support
            sustainability-focused applications. The work combines publicly available data, reproducible code,
            and transparent evaluation so that others can build on the ideas, question the limitations, and
            imagine new ways to connect machine learning with everyday environmental decisions.
          </p>

            All datasets, code, and trained models used in this project are linked through the accompanying
            GitHub repository. The intention is that any interested student, practitioner, or educator can
            re-run the experiments, adapt the model to new settings, or use the visuals as part of broader
            conversations about waste, recycling, and responsible technology.
